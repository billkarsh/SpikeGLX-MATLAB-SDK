Talking live to SpikeGLX from MATLAB
====================================


SpikeGLX Setup
==============

1. Launch SpikeGLX on the data acquisition machine. This machine and the MATLAB client machine must be connected to the same network.

2. Open SpikeGLX dialog 'Options/Command Server Settings...'.

3. Click 'Enable Remote Command Server' and then click 'My Address'.

4. Write down the IP address; you'll need to type that into the MATLAB client code.

Note: You can run SpikeGLX and MATLAB on the same machine, and in this configuration you can either use the computer's actual network address (per step 3), or the 'loopback' address if you don't have a network connection on this computer. Every computer has an internal 'loopback' address set to '127.0.0.1'. Use that with default port number 4142.

Note: If the script times out (about 10 seconds) when trying to connect to SpikeGLX, it may be Windows Firewall blocking access. You might try adding SpikeGLX to the allowed list of applications in the Firewall controls.


MATLAB Setup
============

Needed components are located within Release subfolder 'SpikeGLX-MATLAB-SDK/API'.

1. Create a folder for your MATLAB client project, such as 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'.

2. Copy '@SpikeGL' and 'CalinsNetMex.mexw64' from API into 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'.

3. To get started with example code, copy 'DemoRemoteAPI.m' into 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'.

In summary, your folder looks like:

  My_SGLX_MATLAB
      @SpikeGL
      CalinsNetMex.mexw64
      DemoRemoteAPI.m


Running MATLAB
==============

1. Launch MATLAB, add 'My_SGLX_MATLAB' to your path.

2. Navigate to 'My_SGLX_MATLAB' and open 'DemoRemoteAPI.m'.

3. Edit the line 'hSGL = SpikeGL('10.101.20.29');' to reflect the correct IP address.

4. Go to the section called 'Variety of set/get calls to try' and choose a trial test function by uncommenting it. For example, try 'file = GetDataDir(hSGL)' which will return the data directory whether SpikeGLX is running an acquisition or is currently idle.

5. Experiment with other commands (only a few are demonstrated in this m file).

The full set of commands is in file '@SpikeGL/Contents.m'.

'LatencyTest.m' is a simple demonstration of real-time fetching and
processing of streaming imec probe data.

{wp_XXX.m} demonstrate calling the waveplayer from a script.
